            <h2>What</h2>
            <p>This is my hobby page for the Web App Development Midterm. It may be a little rough around the edges, and I'm not great at graphic design as is, 
                but maybe if I have time, I'll work on it more. This page is to show that we can toggle sections of an
                html page through Javascript, while masquerading as a website to express my hobby.</p>
            <p>My biggest hobby is that of video games! I could wake up, hop on my favorite game at the time, look
                out the window and see it's already dark out. Of course this is likely because I wake up 5 minutes
                before
                dusk. As of now, I mostly play games from the "Monster Hunter" franchise and I am not ashamed to say
                I've
                put in, according to my Nintendo Switch profile, approximately 1300 hours. A hobby is an understatement. 
                In this game, you take on the role of the hunter, tasked with accepting quests to hunt monsters of varying 
                types, each with their own intricate set of attacks, movement patterns, ecology, and more. It's an incredibly 
                immersive game that I just cannot get enough of, and plan on spending many thousands more hours playing!

            <p>Consider this an 'About Me' page. My name is Alec Bronz. I've been playing video games for literally as long
                as I can remember. In fact, my first memory is of me playing Pokemon Ruby on mine or my brother's Gameboy
                Advanced. Despite getting older, my taste in video games has not changed once in my life. I've been playing 
                Super Mario, Pokemon, The Legend of Zelda, and other Nintendo franchises and rarely deviate.</p>
            <p>Gaming isnt just for me. It's for everyone! Tens of millions of people all around the world, my age and younger
                or older are online all the time! Personally, I don't think I'll ever stop playing games. It's as much a part 
                of me as my name. Hopefully I can find a job that works well with my hobby, and one day I'll be able to make 
                video games for a living.

            <h2>Why</h2>
            <p>While I may have briefly described why video games are important to me in other pages, I can elaborate here. The 
                simple answer is that they're fun. If they weren't fun, I wouldn't sink as much time into them as I have. Video games 
                to me are not only a break from reality, but also an escape to a world where the impossible is possible. Unfortunately, I 
                cannot catch a Pokemon in real life or hunt a mountain sized monster either. There are many other aspects that are often 
                overlooked within the hobby of video games. Each one has it's own community, and in that regard it's similar to sports. 
            </p>
            <p>Video games are an ever evolving genre of entertainment. One that I personally hope to contribute to as games are 
                becoming more complex. Not only are the limits of what can be done within the video game world being pushed, but 
                it's become such a world-wide phenomenon that even the Olympics are picking up video games as a category. I believe in the 
                future more and more people will enjoy video games as I have and I hope some will be as inspired as I am to pursue a 
                career in my favorite hobby.

            <p>The greatest part about playing video games in the modern day is that I can play anywhere! My normal set up (shown in the picture above) 
                is the one in my dorm currently.
